<h2>Extract Transform Load</h2>
<p> Amazing Prime Video, the worldâ€™s largest online retailer and streaming. In this module data has been extracted from several sources, cleaned the data and transform. Finally, the data is loaded into SQL. The goal is to create and algorithm so AMV can predict what low budget films will be popular! AMV is sponsoring a hack-a-thon to assist in making these predictions to help get these films so AMV can acquire them at a low price.
